# Titanic Survival Prediction

**Project Overview**: This project provides a web application for predicting Titanic survival chances using a machine learning model. The application is built using Flask, with the entire implementation and model training conducted within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure
├── Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb
└── dataset/
└── train.csv

- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire codebase including data preprocessing, model training, Flask app implementation, and ngrok integration.
- `dataset/titanic_data.csv`: Dataset used for training the model.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Required Python packages (listed below)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MOHAN1665/Titanic_Survival_Prediction
   cd Titanic_Survival_Prediction

2. **Install Required Packages**
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
   ```bash 
   pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy ngrok

4. **Start the Flask Application**
   Open Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
   Run the cells to train the model and start the Flask application.
   The notebook integrates ngrok to expose the Flask app with a public URL.

## Running the Application
Execute the notebook cells to train the model and run the Flask app.
The notebook will display a public URL from ngrok where you can access the web application.

## Accessing the Application
Open the provided ngrok URL in your web browser to interact with the Titanic survival prediction app.

## Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook
Flask (for web application)
scikit-learn (for machine learning)
pandas (for data manipulation)
ngrok (for exposing the local server)

## Notes
The Flask application and model training are integrated within the Jupyter Notebook for ease of use.
Ensure you have a stable internet connection for ngrok to work properly.
